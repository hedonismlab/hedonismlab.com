> What would it be like to bathe in warm coconut oil?

**Slipbath** explores tactility and immersion. It invites a conversation between a very basic sensual experience--warm oil on skin--and the quasi-industrial elements of safety and process control that allow the experience to be interrogated safely from a variety of perspectives. Participants are invited to engage with the concepts through any or all of design, engineering, prototype-building, and depictions of the real *or imagined* experiences in a variety of media.
